## Buying Checklist: What Matters Under $50

- **Material quality:** Stainless steel blades, heat-resistant silicone, or BPA-free plastics prolong gadget life.
- **Warranty length:** Look for at least a 1-year warranty; many reputable brands offer extended coverage on registration.
- **Storage footprint:** Measure cabinets or counters before ordering—especially for air fryers or kettles with large bases.
- **Cleaning process:** Dishwasher-safe is ideal, but note which parts must be hand-washed to avoid dulling blades or warping seals.
- **Power needs:** Some gadgets draw more amps than older circuits can handle; check the wattage if you’re in a dorm/RV.

## Care Tips to Maximize Lifespan

1. **Rotate blades and sharpen regularly.** Use a handheld sharpener on mandoline blades every few weeks to keep cuts precise.
2. **Avoid harsh detergents.** For nonstick or silicone surfaces, mild soap prevents coating breakdown.
3. **Air out electronics.** After using kettles or air fryers, leave lids/baskets open for a few minutes to prevent trapped moisture.
4. **Log firmware/app updates.** Smart thermometers often push new cooking profiles—check the app monthly.

## FAQ

**Can I put these gadgets in the dishwasher?**  
Most listed gadgets have removable parts that are top-rack safe. Electronics (like the Meater probe) need a hand wash with a damp cloth once cooled—never submerge the charging block.

**Do I need special knives for a mandoline?**  
No, but we recommend using the included hand guard or cut-resistant gloves to protect fingers while slicing.

**Will prices match across all retailers?**  
Prices vary by retailer and change frequently with promotions and stock levels. We recommend comparing current prices across multiple retailers (Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Best Buy, and more) before purchasing to find the best deal for you.
